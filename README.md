- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gusthewizard 
- 👀 I’m interested in: learning how to code with the intention to make games, but open to anything really :D
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: just some basic Python tutorials at the moment, but i hope to learn Gamemaker some day or even C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: once i learn how to code i'm open to collaborating on pretty much anything
- 📫 How to reach me: right now, the best way to reach me would probably be to email me at darthaugustin2010@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: i don't like all this woke stuff, in Genesis 1:27 the Bible says: So God created mankind in his own image, male and female he created them.
- ⚡ Fun fact: i have never played a Playstation game before
